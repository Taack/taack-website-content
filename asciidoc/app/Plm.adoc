== Purpose

Manage FreeCAD model sharing and linear versioning.

== Roles

* `ROLE_ADMIN`
* `ROLE_PLM_USER`

See link:Crew.adoc#_purpose[configure roles in Crew] to add the role into your Intranet

== Server Installation

=== Launch FreeCAD on the server

On a Linux server, grab FreeCAD AppImage file, install `xvfb-run`, then launch in background FreeCAD:

[source,bash]
.Launch FreeCAD in background
----
xvfb-run ./FreeCAD_0.20.2-2022-12-27-conda-Linux-x86_64-py310.AppImage
----

=== Install from Server Binaries

Download the latest server binaries from https://github.com/Taack/taack-plm-freecad/releases[releases].

Launch the server app:

[source,bash]
.Launch the server
----
java -jar server-0.3.jar
----

==== Server Arguments

Options to the server can be passed this way:

[source,bash]
.Combining Options
----
java -DOption1=Value1 -DOption2=Value2 ... -jar server-0.3.jar
----

===== Options

* Path the Intranet store its files: `-Dintranet.root=/home/test/someDir`
* Server port: `-Dserver.port=9444`
* Database url:`-DdataSource.url='jdbc:h2:./prodDb2;LOCK_TIMEOUT=10000;DB_CLOSE_ON_EXIT=FALSE'`
* Freecad appimage path: `-Dplm.freecadPath=/somePath...`
* Dot exe path: `-Dexe.dot.path=/somePath...`

=== Install from Source

Clone the #plm# repository:

[source,bash]
.Clone PLM repo
----
git clone git@github.com:Taack/plm.git
----

Then copy the content of the `plm` folder into your intranet `app` folder (see link:../installation.adoc[intranet installation])

Then configure the server to know about this new app by changing `server/build.gradle` file. Grails section should look like this after changes:

[source,gradle]
.server configuration
----
grails {
    exploded = true
    plugins {
        implementation project(':crew')
        // other apps here ...
        implementation project(':plm')
    }
}
----

Set the FreeCAD path in the `server/conf/application.yml` file appending:

[source,yaml]
.Specific PLM Configuration
----
plm:
  freecadPath: ${HOME}/FreeCAD_0.20.2-2022-12-27-conda-Linux-x86_64-py310.AppImage


----

You can also install #graphviz# and set the `dot` executable path. It is used to display graphs and might be useful to display *model dependency graph* in a near future. In `server/conf/application.yml`:

[source,yaml]
.Dot executable configuration
----
exe:
  dot:
    path: /usr/bin/dot
    #path: /opt/homebrew/bin/dot
----


Start your intranet issuing under the `intranet` folder:

[source,bash]
.Run Server from Source
----
./gradlew server:bootRun
----

You can produce a Jar file:

[source,bash]
.Build Server Binary from Source
----
./gradlew server:assemble
----

The server will be located under `server/build/libs`

== FreeCAD Workbench Installation

.Click on Taack icon
image::plm2-screenshot.webp[]

.Enter your credential into your server

WARNING: If you have many links, import them from the same computer. From other computers, download the zip file from your intranet.

That's it, I will record some videos demonstrating this app capabilities.

== Todo

* Add model graph icon
* Update deps for a model (with Deep option)
* Delete latest version
* ...
