== Coding Style Guide for Grails Application Development

Here are the guidelines and coding style recommendations for your Grails application:

- Method Modifiers:
** Use protected, private and final modifiers for methods in a controller that are not actions.
- Coding Style:
** Prioritize concise code, while maintaining clarity.
** Employ the `@GrailsCompileStatic` or `@CompileStatic` annotations throughout the codebase.
- Stateless Actions:
** Always design actions to be stateless and avoid using sessions.
- Controller Traits:
** Refrain from using services to implement Controller traits.
- @Transactional Annotation:
** Reserve the @Transactional annotation solely for controller actions.
- General Rules:
** Use the final modifier when appropriate.
** Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
** Keep the scope of symbols short to enhance code readability.
** Opt for concise and meaningful local variable names.
** Clearly specify public method parameters and member names.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a clean, organized, and expressive codebase for your Grails application.

== i18n

- Do not centralize i18n, use gradle app module `i18n` folders

[,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
}
----
- class name localisation "book.label = Libro"
- class field name localisation "book.title.label = TÃ­tulo del libro"
- To be efficient
** do not translate too early
** when you have a global overview, start translating
** keep the most important label short, use the `default` namespace for them, specialized label can be long
- Use convention for your i18n:
** prefix with "default." everything that will be reused
** do not prefix class name translated
** for labels, prefix with "label."
** for actions, prefix with "action."

We separate within an app module *domains* i18n, from *actions* and other i18n.

Common i18n should be localized into `Crew` app module.

== Configuration

- Use enum, in code, for configuration
** Static is king
** Groovy Enums are readable (more than XML, Json, Yaml ... whatever)

== Security

- Security-related code should be located near the point of influence
** We do want to avoid centralization for all concerns
*** Create a new domain per needs, avoid cluttering `User` class
*** Abstract concepts should be minimized for security purposes; static checks are crucial
- Avoid complex rules that can't be verified statically during compilation
- Administrative rules must not rely on permission strings, a boolean value in an object is more explicit when testing in code.

== You are efficient when:

- Modifications if a functionality is localised in the source code
- Incorporating new features is straightforward
- Different concerns remain isolated or orthogonal, minimizing mutual influence.
