== Coding Style Guide for Grails Application Development

Here are the guidelines and coding style recommendations for your Grails application:

- Method Modifiers:
** Use protected and final modifiers for methods in a controller that are not actions.
- Coding Style:
** Prioritize concise code, while maintaining clarity.
** Employ the @GrailsCompileStatic or @CompileStatic annotations throughout the codebase.
- Stateless Actions:
** Always design actions to be stateless and avoid using sessions.
- Controller Traits:
** Refrain from utilizing services to implement Controller traits.
- @Transactional Annotation:
** Reserve the @Transactional annotation solely for controller actions.
- General Rules:
** Use the final modifier when appropriate.
** Adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
** Keep the scope of symbols low to enhance code readability.
** Opt for concise and meaningful local variable names.
** Clearly specify public method parameters and member names.

By following these guidelines, you can maintain a clean, organized, and expressive codebase for your Grails application.

== i18n

- Do not centralize i18n, use gradle module `i18n` folders
[,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
}
----
- class name localisation "book.label = Libro"
- class field name localisation "book.title.label = TÃ­tulo del libro"
- In order to be efficient
** do not translate too early
** when you have a global overview, start translating
** keep most important label short, use the `default` namespace for them, specialized label can be long
- used convention for your i18n:
** prefix with "default." everything that will be reused
** do not prefix class name translated
** for labels, prefix with "label."
** for actions, prefix with "action."

== Configuration

- Use enum, in code, for configuration
** Static test is the king
** Groovy Enums are more readable than XML, Json, Yaml ... whatever

== Security

- Security-related code should be located near the point of its implementation
** We do want to avoid centralisation for all concerns
*** Create a new domain per needs, avoid cluttering `User` class
*** Abstract concepts should be minimized for security purposes; static checks are crucial
- Avoid complex rules that can't be verified statically during compilation
- Administrative rules must not rely on permission strings, a boolean value in an object is more explicite when testing in code.

== You are efficient when:

- Modifications to a functionality don't cause widespread disruptions
- Incorporating new features is straightforward
- Different concerns remain isolated or orthogonal, minimizing mutual influence.
