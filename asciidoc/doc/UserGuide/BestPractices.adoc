== General

- Use protected and final for methods in a controller that are not actions
- Coding style: "the shortest the better", until you lower expressiveness
- Use `@GrailsCompileStatic` or `@CompileStatic` everywhere
- Always stateless actions, use no sessions
- Avoid services to implement Controller traits
- Do not annotate with `@Transactional` anything but controller actions

- General rules:
** Use final when applicable
** Do not repeat yourself
** keep symbols scope low
** local variable names short
** Explicit public method parameters and member names

== i18n

- Do not centralize i18n, use gradle module `i18n` folders
[,groovy]
----
class Book {
    String title
}
----
- class name localisation "book.label = Libro"
- class field name localisation "book.title.label = TÃ­tulo del libro"
- In order to be efficient
** do not start translations too early
** when you have a global overview, start translating
** keep most important label short, use the `default` namespace for them, specialized label can be long
- used convention for your i18n:
** prefix with "default." everything that will be reused
** do not prefix class name translated
** for labels, prefix with "label."
** for actions, prefix with "action."

== Configuration

- Use enum, in code, for configuration
** Static test is the king
** Groovy Enums are more readable than XML, Json, Yaml ... whatever

== Security

- Code managing security must be close to the place it is used
** We do want to avoid centralisation for all concerns
*** Create a new domain per needs, avoid cluttering `User` class
*** Abstract concept should be avoided for security, static check is the king
- Avoid complex rules that are not checked statically at compile time
- Administrative rules must not rely on permission strings, a boolean value in an object is more explicite when testing in code...

== You are efficient ...

- when you do not break everything for altering a functionality
- when new stuffs can be added easily
- when different concern are kept isolated (or orthogonal, not influencing each other)
