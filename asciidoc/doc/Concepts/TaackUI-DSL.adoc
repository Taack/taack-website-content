== Foreword about Block DSL, before digging in other DSLs

The Block DSL enables the specification of page layout by defining blocks that contain other graphical elements. A block can be an AJAX block, which can be updated by AJAX actions. `AJAX blocks` can be targeted using their ID. Blocks can also be nested.

For more information, please refer to the dedicated page on link:../DSLs/block-dsl.adoc[Block DSL]. PDFs have their own block management through link:../DSLs/block-printable-dsl.adoc[Printable Blocks], while the table and show DSLs are also applicable (charts will be available later).

    }
