== Intellij

In addition, you could also import the Taack-UI Live Templates to be able to get boilerplate code out of the way easily like so:

video::6ADI8FrnIzg[youtube,title=IntelliJ Live Templates, opts="autoplay,loop", width=640, height=480]

To do that download `taack-intellij-templates.zip` on the  https://github.com/Taack/taack-autocomplete/releases/tag/v1.6[release page].
Then on IntelliJ, go to `File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings`.After picking the file, click "OK" when IntelliJ asks you what you want to import, and you're good to go.
