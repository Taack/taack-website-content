== DSL, Grails, Security, Validity

https://github.com/Taack/infra[Taack-UI] is a https://grails.org/[Grails] plugin that extends the functionality of Grails by allowing the description of user interface and other features using the http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html[Groovy DSL] (Domain Specific Language) with static typing.

== Features

This extension adds the following functionalities to classical Grails Application:

* Security:
** Transforming and displaying objects by checking user rights to modify *each field*;
** *links* and *form actions* are automatically hidden if the user is not allowed to process the  *action* with the given parameters;
** Limiting object listing that the user is allowed to see (except for full-text search at the moment);

* *PDF*, *Mails*, *CSV* are rendered for free. The link:doc/DSLs/block-dsl.adoc[block DSL] can be used for rendering in any format;

* Localization is provided for free as the DSL detects i18n translations automatically;

* Reporting errors during Object validation for free (refer to link:doc/DSLs/form-dsl.adoc#_form_validation[*form validation*]);

* Solr is used for link:/more/Search/Search.adoc[fulltext search] offering features such as:
** Indexing and fulltext Search of domain objects statically typed;
** Faceting;
** Ranking;

* link:/doc/DSLs/filter-table-dsl.adoc[Filtering, paginate and sorting] data without queries and session data;
* File previews can be extended;
* *JDBC Driver* to query Domain Objects using #TQL# (Taack Query Language) from Intellij, link:more/JDBC/libreoffice-base.adoc#_open_query_as_a_pivot_table[LibreOffice Base] or DBeaver, as a classical datasource (See link:more/JDBC/taack-jdbc-driver.adoc[*Taack JDBC Driver*]);

* File sharing via *SFTP* (Available soon) provides:
** Virtual File System for each user along with an SFTP file browser (see <<sftp_screenshot>>);
** Direct access to parts of the server storage for fast and efficient sharing while ensuring user credentials are checked;

* *Git server* to manage user documentation (Available soon)

* *Ssh* support will be accessible, running shell UI directly within the server process (Coming soon; see <<ssh_screenshot>>);
