https://github.com/Taack/infra[Taack-UI] is a plugin extending https://grails.org/[Grails] by allowing to describe user interface and other features by using http://docs.groovy-lang.org/docs/latest/html/documentation/core-domain-specific-languages.html[Groovy DSL] (Domain Specific Language) statically typed.

This extension add the following functionalities to classical Grails Application:

* Solr for link:/more/Search/Search.adoc[fulltext search]:

** Faceting;
** Ranking;

* link:/doc/DSLs/filter-table-dsl.adoc[Filtering, paginate and sorting] data without queries and session data;

* *JDBC Driver* to query Domain Objects using #TQL# (Taack Query Language) from Intellij, link:more/JDBC/libreoffice-base.adoc#_open_query_as_a_pivot_table[LibreOffice Base] or DBeaver, as a classical datasource (See link:more/JDBC/taack-jdbc-driver.adoc[*Taack JDBC Driver*]);

* File sharing via *SFTP* (Available soon):
** Virtual File System for each user (see <<sftp_screenshot>>);
