* PDF, Mails, CSV, other for free, the block DSL can be used for any kind of rendering;

* Solr for fulltext search:
** Indexing and fulltext Search of domain objects statically typed;
** Faceting;
** Ranking;

* Filtering, paginate and sorting data without queries and session data;
* File previews can be extended;
* JDBC Driver to query Domain Objects using #TQL# (Taack Query Language) from Intellij, LibreOffice Base or DBeaver, as a classical datasource;

* File sharing via SFTP:
