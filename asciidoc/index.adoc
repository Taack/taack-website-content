= DSL for Grails
:taack-category: 1

https://github.com/Taack/infra[Taack-UI] is a plugin extending https://grails.org/[Grails] by allowing to describe user interface and additional features using DSL (Domain Specific Language) statically typed.

This extension simplify the following functionalities against classical Grails Application:

* Security:
** Transforming and displaying objects checking autorisations for the connected user;
** Managing access, mask links and form actions in a central place;
** Object listing can display only data accessible to the user without using `params`;

* PDF, Mails, CSV, other for free, the link:doc/DSLs/block-dsl.adoc[block DSL] can be used for any kind of rendering;

* Reporting errors when validating an Object at no cost (See link:doc/DSLs/form-dsl.adoc#_form_validation[*form validation*]);

* Solr for link:/more/Search/Search.adoc[fulltext search]:
** Indexing and fulltext Search of domain objects statically typed;
** Faceting;
** Ranking;

* link:/doc/DSLs/filter-table-dsl.adoc[Filtering, paginate and sorting] data without queries and session data;
* File previews can be extended;
* JDBC Driver to query Domain Objects using #TQL# (Taack Query Language) from Intellij, LibreOffice Base or DBeaver, as a classical datasource;

* File sharing via SFTP:
** Virtual File System for each user (see <<sftp_screenshot>>);
** Direct access to parts of the server storage for fast sharing, checking user credentials;

* Experimental shell support accessible via Ssh, running the UI directly into the server (see <<ssh_screenshot>>);
