We strongly recommend doing the first-app project before as this is a continuation of that project.

Description of the project:

== Set up
=== Cloning the ready-to-dev Intranet

.Clone the starter repository:

[source,bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/Taack/intranet.git
$ cd intranet/app/
$ git clone https://github.com/Taack/myLibrary.git
$ cd myLibrary
----

This will clone the intranet and then clone the skeleton of the app myLibrary that we will be creating here.
